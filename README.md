Phase 1: Design and Layout, JavaScript Reflection Objects

For this project you will develop the following:

Use JavaScript prompts for entering Reflections into your journal
Implement the JavaScript necessary to process and validate the submitted data
Use JavaScript to create Reflection object instances and display them in the console AND browser
 (Links to an external site.)Requirements:
When the user clicks the 'Add Journal Entries' button, use JavaScript prompts for entering reflections consisting of the following items:
Creation Date - Prompt for a date
Confidence Level - Prompt the user to specify Low, Medium, and High confidence level (your implementation should handle any entry regardless of upper or lowercase and any entry that does not match one of the 3 options should be rejected with an error message alert and the user should be prompted to re-enter their confidence level value)
Describe your confidence level in your skills at the time of posting
Journal Entry - Prompt the user for the text for your reflection
Enter in as much text as necessary about what you learned, how you felt, and plans for the upcoming days
Post Reflection - Use a confirm dialog box to confirm the post/record your journal entry (if the user selects OK, add post to the array, otherwise if they click cancel start over with prompts and entry)
Define a JavaScript object literal that will represent a journal entry
Implement JavaScript to handle the values entered for the journal entry
When a journal entry is submitted/confirmed, create a new journalEntry object and add it to a journalEntries array
After each submission
Add the entry to the journalEntries array
Add an unordered list (ul) to the DOM
Add create date as a list item (li) element to the unordered list
Add confidence entry as a list item (li) element to the unordered list
Add entry text as a list item (li) element to the unordered list
Use a function that you implement to iterate the list of entries in the array, and using template literals, render all of the entries in the console (Note: Log each property of each entry item. NOT full array or entry object)
Allow the user to continue to submit entries as long as they choose until they enter 'quit' (optionally add support to stop entering entries if they click cancel in prompt dialog)
 (Links to an external site.)Examples:
/*  Purpose: create a reflection journal entry object
    Arguments: create_date, entry, confidence
*/ 
function addJournalEntry(create_date, entry, confidence)
{
      // Create a new journal object
      let newEntry = {
             creation_date: create_date, 
             journal_entry: entry,
             confidence_level: confidence              
      }

      // Add the entry to the Array and to the DOM (u do this...)

      // Call your logJournalEntries function to log all entries in the array to the console
}

/*
    Purpose: To render all reflection journal entries to the console
*/
function logJournalEntries()
{
    // iterate your entries array and log each entry (and each individual property) in the console
}
Use CSS to format the entries on your web page as you choose and be creative!
Stretch Goals
Use an HTML form instead of prompt() for a user to make new entries
Output your journal entries in an HTML table
Experiment with using the Bootstrap CSS library to enhance the look and feel of your project Bootstrap Introduction (Links to an external site.)
Add the capability to delete existing entries by their index number
Add the capability to edit existing entries by their index number and update the entry in the array
 (Links to an external site.)General Project Information:
The Reflections Journal project will leverage the development concepts you learn in class and apply them to build a Reflections Journal web application.

 (Links to an external site.)Guidelines:
This is an individual project and Students should perform all work independently
You can use your past notes and online sources as necessary, but first, try to implement the solution based on your current knowledge noting any areas where you get stuck so you can go back and review those concepts
Instructors will assist students, however, it is up to the individual student to come up with the answers
You will present your solution to the class and field any questions about your implementation (presentation 5 - 10 mins)
Commit and Push your work often (you must push a version of your project by 4 pm the day of the project)
NOTE: Final submissions must be pushed to your GitHub repo before Thursday 10 PM 8/5/2021
Projects will be pulled promptly at 10:00 PM!
